🦁 Jungle King: The Sovereign Accord
Jungle King is an ecological strategy simulation where you must balance the delicate threads of nature. As the Sovereign, your decrees shape the future of the forest, the beasts, and your folk.

⚖️ The Laws of the Valley

To win, you must maintain Harmony for a set number of seasons.

The Harmony Ratio: You must keep the ratio of Lions to Deer between 0.12 and 0.42.

The Spring Echo (Change): Your actions have immediate impacts, but Nature has a memory. Deer births are determined by the forest health of the previous season.

The Winter Weight (Decay): Time is your greatest enemy. As the seasons pass, the Weight (w) of the world grows, making hunger, overgrazing, and starvation much more severe.

🎮 How to Play

Choose Your Crown: Select between Low, Medium, and High difficulty.

Issue Decrees:

Hunt Deer: Reduces deer population but slightly damages the forest.

Hunt Lions: Removes a predator but risks a trophic collapse.

Expand Village: Increases your people, but costs significant forest land.

Protect Forest: Heal the land, though regrowth is slower if the deer herd is too large.

Survive the Wall: On Low difficulty, the weight of the world grows sharply after Season 8. Can you reach the win target before the Decay becomes unstoppable?

🛠️ Technical Details

Built with Python and Streamlit. The simulation uses a stochastic Monte Carlo-tested engine to balance predator-prey dynamics and trophic cascades.
